Module_6 homework

**WeatherPy**
0606 started with WeatherPy and no issues up to creating the csv

Plots
    - adding grid: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8209568/how-do-i-draw-a-grid-onto-a-plot-in-python
    - adding edge on symbol: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50706901/matplotlib-border-around-scatter-plot-points
    - subracting a value to convert temp: https://www.includehelp.com/python/how-to-subtract-a-single-value-from-column-of-pandas-dataframe.aspx

0607 used examples from module 6 for plots. No issues.

0608 finished WeatherPy without issues
figured out some text formatting in Jupyter Notebook

**VacationPy**
0608 started VacatioPy
to add empty column used df['Hotel Name']="" but that gave an error.  Insert syntax worked https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-empty-column-to-dataframe-in-pandas/

0608
nearly done with VacationPy - relied on previous in class excersizes to create graph. Last thing is to add hover text and a summary
